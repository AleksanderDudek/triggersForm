# TriggersForm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

Since original task requirements proved to be troublesome I decided to use the most current stable versions.
The reason behind that was I spent a few hours matching dependencies in package.json. Also I assumed that
the main reason was to check one's skillset in 7.x version. Thus I allowed myself to change the version.

Also I added router to Home Page ('/list') as a little improvement.
